# project-obj-dos-cmd-python-slave
Make Python script slave of dos cmd batch command

Some Python scrips to object-obj.

Used for geo projection for Build The Earth 1 to 1

New: Master-Slave system to keep python script in memory and feeding it with data-items or whole files one by one or in batches.
(list_to_geo.py)

Preliminary version.
Will be extended to put all geo / minecraft x/z conversion formulas into one script for external use.
Programs can feed the script that remains in memory, so external program don't have to make multiple calls loading the .py or .exe script.
Blah blah.
